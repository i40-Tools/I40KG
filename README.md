# StandardsVocabulary
Standard Ontology (STO) is used for describing standards and their relations. Characteristics of I4.0 standards
are described using STO, and these descriptions are exploited for classifying standards from different perspectives according
to reference architectures. Moreover, semantics encoded in STO allows for the discovery of relations between I4.0 standards, and
for mappings across reference architectures proposed by different industrial communities.
